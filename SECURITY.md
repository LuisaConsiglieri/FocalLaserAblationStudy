# Security Policy

To report a security issue (security vulnerability in GitHub), please report it through the coordinated disclosure process or use the GitHub Security Advisory "Report a Vulnerability" tab.

Otherwise, to address a reported vulnerability as a security issue in my repository, or a simple bug, we appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings. Any concerns and advice provided by the vulnerability reporter will be taken into careful consideration, and are welcome as they provide more efficiency, efficacy and effectiveness in the fixing process.

Please direct any requests, reports or issues to me https://sites.google.com/site/luisaconsiglieri or https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisa-da-cunha-consiglieri-73a3b640
as this repository is an one-person maintainer and will not always be up to date.
